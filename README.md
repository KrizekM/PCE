# PCE
Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is a method used to approximate system outputs with uncertain inputs by representing them as a series of orthogonal polynomials. It efficiently propagates uncertainty through models, enabling statistical analysis of output variability without extensive simulations.
